# Who Am I?
Who Am I? I'm still trying to find an answer to that question. I mean I wouldn't put "Existentialism of a linux user" as the description of the website without a reason. But in simple terms, I'm just a guy who found his life calling when he was seeing the boot screen of linux for the first time.
